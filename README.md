## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
- GitHub Pages


### What I learned

I used SASS for the first time on this project. I mostly used variables for colors and nesting for styling buttons in the different cards.

I deployed the website on GitHub Pages, which is new to me.


### Continued development

I'm going to continue to use more SASS and Flexbox, and I'll explore more options for deployment.
